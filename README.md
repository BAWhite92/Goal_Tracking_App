An app to track users goals and graphically represent them in graph format. 

Starting with console or IDE based running until a GUI is developed.

Many features to be added such as choosing graph format, editing setting/options for colour etc, GUI, setting ability to increment goal progress, 
setting increment size for goals, altering existing goals, numerous other additions to be considered.

This project is an exploratory learning process to further develop my Python skills and knowledge.

Latest files add database use (SQLite) for saving and tracking goals, I have included the original system which used .txt files to save and track the goal
names and progress percentages to show skills in file manipulation and string manipulation but progressing forward will be implementing an SQLite database
approach to creating the app.
